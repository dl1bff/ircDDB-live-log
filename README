ircDDB livelog

View live ircDDB data on the web. 


Needs:

http://jquery.com/

 (install  jquery-1.4.2.min.js  in the web server directory)


http://yaws.hyber.org/
 
 (Web server written in Erlang)


GNU-awk

(Debian package gawk, not the default mawk)

 

How does it work?

The gen_livelog2_txt.sh script uses the debug log output of 
this software:  http://github.com/dl1bff/ircDDB-DV  MemDB.java.
It generates a text file with fixed record length of 99 chars plus
one newline character -> 100 bytes per line. This file is used by
the Erlang script jj3.yaws which runs inside a YAWS web server.
Requests to the server look like this:  http://example.com/jj3.yaws?p=pos 
where <pos> is the line position in the text file. Not more than 100
lines are returned.  In the client browser, livelog3.js requests
the latest log lines every 5 seconds.
